# ReSteel
My project working on reverse-engineering the USB protocol for the Arctis Pro Wireless headset made by SteelSeries.

The end result is hopefully a driver for Linux or some utility so I can get the charge percentage from the base station and later on include more features.

Surround sound support for this headset is not something that I will be developing since that includes reverse-engineering the software the steelseries engine installs, which is against the terms of service of the software. (Also, the really annoying interface of the SteelSeries GG engine is written in electron, which I just don't wanna touch)

This is just a project that doesn't have really anything since I'm working on capturing and just analyzing the USB data that wireshark captures between the USB connection on the base station and the computer. If you want to help, feel free to either open a pull request or issue.

This is just a side project for me, I work long hours on my feet all the time at work, so I'll put in as much effort I can muster, but it won't be a lot until I get a breakthrough and can start to write code.
